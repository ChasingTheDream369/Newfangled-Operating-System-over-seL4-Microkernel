## Summary

‚Ä¢ Created an operating system over the world‚Äôs most secure and completely formally verified microkernel seL4 with Formulating
a completely threaded execution model for the Operating system encapsulated in servers. Started the process by creating a
separate File server, Process management server, and one thread completely dedicated to handling interrupts.

‚Ä¢ Made sure that each user thread has a private endpoint with which it communicates using its own thread and used two con-
currency handling locks including the locks for Cspace, ut allocator, and frame table while other synchronization requirements
were handled implicitly by the servers.

‚Ä¢ All the User threads used endpoints to invoke system calls and had their own endpoint and kernel thread leading to concurrent
system calls and parallely we saved the reply objects in a structure concurrently trying to reply later on for both file and
process management.

‚Ä¢ On top of it we created a timer device driver and did the file descriptor allocation using a bitmap. Created a separate Serial
interface and file server. Created a 4-level page table using virtual addresses as indices and enforced read-only permissions.
Further furnished with creating demand paging, VM fault handling, and also data transfer between different address spaces.
For dealing with elf loading we read the elf header and created a procedure to find the vsyscall section and created specific
states, and a formal pid allocator for newly created processes. We tried not to replicate our PIDs but made sure to reuse
thread resources under reply objects and also made sure that all long blocking procedures get blocked inside the process
management loop so that the processes can prematurely come out of blocking and further used an explicitly managed device
queue for the same.

‚Ä¢ Overall received a 99% in the bench marking results.

<!-- System Calls Section -->
## üìû System Calls

SOS simplifies interaction with the kernel through well-defined system call numbers:

| **Syscall Number** | **Syscall Name**     |
|--------------------|-----------------------|
| NR openat          | sos_sys_open          |
| NR close           | sos_sys_close         |
| NR read            | sos_sys_read          |
| NR write           | sos_sys_write         |
| ...                | ...                   |

Explore the full list of system calls in our [System Calls Documentation](system_calls.md).

<!-- Virtual Memory Section -->
## üíæ Virtual Memory

### Page Table Structure

Our page table structure closely resembles the hardware page tables on the ARMv8-A architecture. It features 4 levels of tables, each containing 512 entries. Each entry keeps track of memory management structures, ensuring efficient memory access.

### Modifications to the Frame Table Structure

We've extended the frame entry table structure to include fields like `no evict`, `used`, `dirty`, and `user page cap`. These additions enhance memory management and demand paging.

### Demand Paging

SOS efficiently manages pagefiles and implements the second-chance clock replacement algorithm. This reduces write operations, enhancing system performance.

### Memory Layout and VM Fault Handling

Our memory layout follows a straightforward pattern with distinct segments. VM fault handling is robust, guaranteeing system reliability.

<!-- Process Management Section -->
## üîÑ Process Management

### Process ID Allocation

Process IDs are simply the index of a given process in the process management static array. This straightforward allocation method ensures efficient and unique process identification.

### Process Creation

The Process Management Server (PM server) oversees process creation, efficiently allocating resources for SOS threads and user threads.

### Blocking and Waiting for Access to Devices

SOS efficiently handles thread blocking and waiting for device access. Threads requesting access to a device are placed in a queue and suspended, ensuring smooth execution.

### Killing a Process

SOS provides a robust process termination mechanism. When a process is killed, its resources are cleaned up, and the PM server efficiently manages the termination process.
